# Clavis Aethiopica

No, this is not *the* official Clavis Aethiopica. It is a nifty viewer that uses a static site generator to make it easier to view data from the actual Clavis, which is a part of the [Beta maṣāḥəft](https://betamasaheft.eu) project. Because it's a static site, it loads relatively quickly and works even when Beta maṣāḥəft's server is down.

This site was conceived and coded by [Augustine Dickinson](https://augustinedickinson.com).
